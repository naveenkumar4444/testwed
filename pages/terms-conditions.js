            <li>
              Without this license, Wedcell would be unable to provide the

              Wedcell is able to use its affiliates and subcontractors such as
              Internet content delivery networks to provide the Wedcell), and

              Content from the Wedcell Services, which license shall continue in

              info@wedcell.com and include a brief description of the item(s) to

            written for vendors on their Wedcell profile are a very important
            tool for customers as well as vendors. We therefore take utmost care
            to uphold the integrity & credibility of reviews on our platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can report a review as being false to Wedcell for Verification
            at <b>reviews@wedcell.com</b> or <b>info@wedcell.com.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Wedcell team will contact the Vendor within 48 hours and ask to
            submit them aforementioned proof for the review. The verification
            case will be closed if the vendor fails to submit the proof within 7

            review will be removed from the vendor profile within 1 week, after
            notification to the vendor & the reviewer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that Wedcell cannot & does not verify and confirm to every
            statement written in the reviews on vendor profiles. However, we
            maintain a fair verification process of the reviews once reported to
            ensure that reviews on Wedcell are posted by genuine clients of
            vendors and that they follow our terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wedcell reserves the right to disable a review of the reviewer who
            has been proven to not hire the vendor through involvement of
            Wedcell, for any reason. Wedcell has the sole discretion to decide
            whether reported reviews are to be further investigated or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wedcell prides itself in ensuring authentic and genuine reviews that
            can help engaged couples make better hiring decisions. As a platform
            committed to showcasing honest reviews, we request our vendors to
            abide by the following guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Vendor can ask their clients to review their Profile on Wedcell
            and share their profile link with them & ask them to write a review,
            or, could simply ask them to share their review & rating with us
            on info@wedcell.com & we will get the review uploaded on their
            behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best way to get positive reviews is by delighting your clients.
            Selective solicitation is a strict NO. Offering any type of
            compensation, getting your family/relatives/team members to write a
            review for you is completely unacceptable & such reviews would be
            removed without any intimation
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you agree with the feedback or not, we recommend you take
            the criticism in good stride. In cases of a negative review, we
            strongly suggest you reply to the review with your side of the story
            as it shows that you care. From our statistics, we have seen that
            users read both sides of the story and take an impartial call while
            reading reviews. Moreover, some of the most popular and booked
            vendors on Wedcell have also received negative reviews on their
            profiles so you don't need to worry.Also, another way to mitigate
            the impact would be to get more positive reviews on your profile so
            that the negative review is pushed down & your average rating is
            improved.
          </p>
          <p>Deletion of Profile of Vendor:</p>
          <p>
            Wedcell does not permit or facilitate account deletions of Vendors,
            once made. The account may be marked as unclaimed and be made
            unsearchable upon the platform’s discretion Vendor’s request.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please note, a vendor’s profile may be created even without their
            prior consent. One such method of this is creating a profile with
            the users submitting reviews of vendors who don’t have an active,
            listed profile on Wedcell yet
          </p>
